# Astrodynamics
Personal projects for learning astrodynamics.

The [satellite_transfer_1.ipynb](https://github.com/neelaydoshi/Astrodynamics/blob/main/satellite_transfer_1.ipynb) runs a simple [code](https://github.com/neelaydoshi/Astrodynamics/blob/main/utils.py) for visualizing a satellite being launched from Earth and arriving to Mars.

It is a simple 3-body problem code wherein trajectory of the satellite is determined by the gravitational pull of both the Sun and Mars.

You can play around with the satellite trajectory by:
- changing the initial position of Earth and Mars.
- changing the launch velocity of the satellite.
- changing the duration of the simulation.
